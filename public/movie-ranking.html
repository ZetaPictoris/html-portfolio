<h1>My Top Four Movies</h1>
<h2>According to Martin</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Die Hard</h3>
<p>The first of the Die Hard movie is arguably the best! Bruce Willis in his prime and the action packed scenes were great!</p>

<h3>2. The Fifth Element</h3>
<p>Another Bruce Willis film, this is classed as a sci-fi opera. Action, music, and a great cast.</p>

<h3>3. Air Force One</h3>
<p>This movie, starring Harrison Ford, is set on the US Presidents Airplane. It also stars Gary Oldman who portrays a rebel russian militia soldier.</p>

<h3>4. The Matrix</h3>
<p>Are we living in a simulation? This is what The Matrix suggests. Keanu Reeves expertly potrays NEO, Humanities Saviour.</p>
